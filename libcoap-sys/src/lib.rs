//! Auto-generated unsafe bindings to [libcoap](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap), generated using
//! [bindgen](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen).
//!
//! This crate allows direct (but unsafe) usage of the libcoap C library from Rust. The declarations
//! made in this library are generated automatically using bindgen, for further documentation on how
//! to use them, refer to the [libcoap documentation](https://libcoap.net/documentation.html).
//!
//! In most cases you probably want to use the safe wrapper provided by the libcoap-rs crate or
//! another coap library written in pure Rust such as [coap-rs](https://github.com/covertness/coap-rs)
//! instead.
//!
//! The TLDR for building libcoap-sys (and resolving the most common Build Issues)
//! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! It is strongly recommended that you read the remainder of this page in order to fully understand
//! the build process and possible causes of errors, especially if you're cross-compiling or
//! building for embedded targets.
//!
//! However, if you lack the time to do so, the following instructions should work in most cases:
//!
//! 1. Add a dependency to this crate and add all features you need for your crate to work.
//!    Call [`coap_startup_with_feature_checks()`] instead of [`coap_startup()`] during
//!    initialization to ensure that all of these features are actually available in the linked
//!    version of `libcoap`.
//!
//! 2. If you require DTLS support and run into `Required feature "dtls-(psk|pki|rpk|...)" is not
//!    supported by libcoap` errors, manually select a DTLS library that supports all of your
//!    required DTLS features by setting the `LIBCOAP_RS_DTLS_BACKEND` environment variable to your
//!    desired choice (the library name in all-lowercase should work).
//!
//! 3. If you're building a binary crate (or tests, examples, ...) and are getting non-DTLS-related
//!    `Required feature "<FEATURE>" is not supported by libcoap` errors, enable the `vendored`
//!    feature to build and statically link a version of libcoap that supports exactly the features
//!    you requested.
//!
//! 4. Inspect your dependency tree to determine whether you already have a DTLS library's sys-crate
//!    (`openssl-sys`, `tinydtls-sys` or `mbedtls-sys-auto`) in your dependency tree.
//!    If this is the case, enable the `dtls-<LIBRARY NAME>-sys` feature for all of them.
//!    This may resolve issues related to linking multiple versions of the same library at once, and
//!    could also help in reducing binary size.
//!    
//! If you're still unable to compile `libcoap-sys`, refer to the documentation below.
//! If the documentation below does not solve your issue, feel free to open an issue
//! [on GitHub](https://github.com/namib-project/libcoap-rs/) and ask for help.
//!
//! Optional Features
//! --------------
//! Most features specified in this crate's Cargo.toml directly correspond to a feature that can be
//! enabled or disabled in libcoap's configure-script and/or CMake configuration, refer to the
//! libcoap documentation for more details on these features.
//!
//! The `default` feature should match the default features enabled in the configure script of the
//! minimum supported version of libcoap.
//!
//! Depending on the build system and linked version of libcoap, the features actually provided may
//! differ from the ones indicated by the crate features.
//! If you want to ensure that all features that are enabled for this crate are actually supported
//! by the linked version of libcoap, you may call [`coap_startup_with_feature_checks()`].
//!
//! Aside from the features relating to libcoap functionality, the following features may also be
//! enabled for this crate:
//! - `vendored`: Build and statically link against a version of libcoap bundled with this crate
//!     instead of using a system-provided one[^1].
//! - `dtls-<LIBRARY NAME>-sys`: Allows the [vendored](#vendored-build-system) libcoap version to link against the
//!     same version of a DTLS library that is used by the corresponding <LIBRARY NAME>-sys
//!     crate[^2].
//!     Note, however, that this does not imply that this DTLS library *will* be used, refer to
//!     the [documentation below](#dtls-library-selection) for more information.
//!
//!     If a different build system than `vendored` is used, this feature is effectively a no-op.
//! - `dtls-<LIBRARY NAME>-sys-vendored` instructs the sys-crate of the DTLS library corresponding
//!     to the feature name to use a vendored version of the underlying library (implies
//!     `dtls-<LIBRARY NAME>-sys`).
//! - `dtls-(cid|psk|pki|pkcs11|rpk)`: Require support for specific DTLS features in `libcoap`.
//!     These features can not be enabled explicitly while building `libcoap`, support for them is
//!     automatically made available based on the used DTLS library (see
//!     [the corresponding section below](#dtls-library-selection)).
//!
//!     Enabling these features will add appropriate checks during compile- and/or runtime
//!     initialization to ensure these features are available in the used DTLS library (or panic
//!     otherwise).
//!
//! [^1]: Note that when building for the ESP-IDF, this feature will be a no-op, as the version
//!       provided by the ESP-IDF will always be used.
//! [^2]: In the case of `mbedtls`, `mbedtls-sys-auto` is used instead, as `mbedtls-sys` is
//!       unmaintained.
//!
//! Build Process
//! -------------
//! In general, `libcoap-sys` supports four different build systems, which will be explained in more
//! detail in the following sections:
//! - `vendored`: Build libcoap from source using a bundled version of the library (requires the
//!               `vendored` feature to be enabled.
//! - `pkgconfig`: Link against a system-provided version of libcoap, obtaining the library and
//!                include paths using the `pkg-config` utility.
//! - `manual`: Provide include and library directories+compiler/linker flags via environment
//!             variables.
//! - `espidf`: Build for the ESP family of microcontrollers using the ESP-IDF framework (used
//!             instead of the regular `vendored` build if the build system is set to `vendored` and
//!             building for an ESP-IDF Rust target).
//!
//! The build system that should be used can be specified manually by setting the
//! `LIBCOAP_RS_BUILD_SYSTEM` environment variable to the corresponding value.
//!
//! If you have explicitly specified a build system and building using that system fails, no other
//! system will be tried.
//!
//! If you do not explicitly provide a build system to use, the build script will follow these
//! steps to determine a suitable build system:
//!
//! 1. If the `vendored` crate feature is enabled, or we are building for the ESP-IDF, act as if the
//!    build system is set to `vendored`. If a vendored build is attempted and fails, return with an
//!    error and do not try anything else.
//! 2. Otherwise, try `pkgconfig` first.
//! 3. If `pkgconfig` doesn't work, fall back to `manual` (which will fail if the environment
//!    variables aren't set).
//! 4. If `manual` doesn't work, return an error indicating the issues with all previously attempted
//!    build systems.
//!
//! ## Generic Information (applies to all build systems)
//! The following information applies to all build systems (although some specifics may be detailed
//! in the respective build system's section).
//!
//! ### C Standard Library Functions
//! Some `libcoap` functions utilize types from the C standard library (e.g., `sockaddr_in` in
//! `coap_address_t`).
//!
//! For most targets, the data types defined in the [`libc`](https://docs.rs/libc/latest/libc/)
//! crate will be used to provide those data types.
//! However, some targets (especially embedded ones such as `espidf`) will use a different library
//! instead, which may cause compilation issues in code that assumes `libc` data types to be
//! compatible.
//!
//! For your convenience, this crate re-exports the used standard library crate as the `c_stdlib`
//! module. For best interoperability, you should `use` this module instead of using the actual
//! crates directly to import the required data types.
//!
//! ### DTLS Library Selection
//!
//! In order to provide DTLS support, `libcoap` must be combined with a DTLS library/backend.
//! DTLS libraries are mutually exclusive, and multiple versions of `libcoap` linked against
//! different DTLS libraries may be installed in a system simultaneously, so `libcoap-sys` must
//! decide on a variant of `libcoap` to link against during build.
//!
//! While the default mechanism for determining a DTLS library differs between build systems, you
//! may select a DTLS library explicitly by setting the `LIBCOAP_RS_DTLS_BACKEND` environment
//! variable to any of the supported values (`gnutls`, `openssl`, `mbedtls`, `tinydtls`, or
//! `wolfssl`). Refer to the build-system-specific documentation for information about supported
//! DTLS libraries and specifics.
//!
//! Note that some DTLS-related features (such as `dtls-(cid|psk|pki|pkcs11|rpk)`) are dependent on
//! the used DTLS backend, refer to [the `coap_encryption(3)` man page](https://libcoap.net/doc/reference/4.3.5/man_coap_encryption.html)
//! for information on supported features for each DTLS library.
//!
//! ### Feature Support and Compile-Time/Initialization Checks
//! During compilation, each build system will attempt to ensure that the used version of `libcoap`
//! does in fact support all [features](#optional-features) that were enabled in `Cargo.toml`.
//! The exact method differs based on each build system, but most will attempt to parse the
//! `coap3/coap_defines.h` header file in order to determine missing features (with `espidf` being a
//! notable exception).
//!
//! If a build system detects that a requested feature is missing, an appropriate error message will
//! be returned. In most cases, these errors must be resolved by linking to a different version of
//! `libcoap`.
//!
//! Unfortunately, for various reasons, this compile-time feature check may produce false
//! positive and/or false negative results (especially when cross compiling[^3])
//! is not available for all features (especially ones dependent on the DTLS library) and may not
//! even be available at all on some platforms.
//!
//! Therefore, library users should assume that the compile-time checks may not provide accurate
//! results, and should call [`coap_startup_with_feature_checks()`] during initialization to perform
//! run-time checks for all requested features. This run-time check will always work and be
//! accurate.
//!
//! Lastly, if you encounter a false positive error (i.e., a compile time error that indicates that
//! some feature is missing, even though you are 100% certain that it is available), you may bypass
//! the compile-time checks by setting `LIBCOAP_RS_BYPASS_COMPILE_FEATURE_CHECKS` to any non-zero
//! value.
//! Note, however, that this might lead to cryptic errors if your assumption was wrong and the
//! feature is not available after all.
//!
//! In most cases, a false positive might be caused by the include paths/header files used for
//! binding generation refering to a different version of `libcoap` than the one that is linked
//! against, which could also cause difficult-to-debug issues and indicates a more severe problem
//! with the build process.
//!
//! [^3]: For this reason, using this method [is noted to be unsafe in `libcoap`'s documentation](https://libcoap.net/doc/reference/4.3.5/man_coap_supported.html).
//!
//! ## Vendored Build System
//!
//! The vendored build system uses a bundled version of libcoap (usually the latest stable version
//! at the time of release) to build and statically link against.
//! Under the hood, it uses the [`autotools`](https://docs.rs/autotools/latest/autotools/) crate to
//! configure and run the build process, and you may therefore customize the build's compiler and
//! linker flags by setting the environment variables used in `libcoap`'s `configure` script.
//!
//! This build system will enable only those features in `libcoap` that are requested as
//! `Cargo.toml` features, and will explicitly disable all other ones.
//!
//! If a DTLS library is explicitly selected by the user, it will instruct libcoap to link against
//! that library by setting the corresponding `--with-<LIBRARY NAME>` configure flag.
//!
//! If you enable the `dtls-<LIBRARY NAME>-sys` features and do not set the `<LIBRARY NAME>_CFLAGS`
//! or `<LIBRARY NAME>_LIBS` environment variables, this build system will set these environment
//! variables to ensure that if this DTLS library is the one that libcoap uses, we link against
//! exactly the same version as used in the `<LIBRARY NAME>-sys` crate.
//! This is especially relevant if those crates also provide a `vendored` version in order to avoid
//! multiple versions of the same library being in use.
//! If a different DTLS library is used, this feature should have no effect (it will set the
//! environment variable, but `libcoap` will ignore it).
//!
//! If you do not specify a DTLS library, this build system will follow the same default order that
//! libcoap does (gnutls > openssl > wolfssl > mbedtls > tinydtls), unless you enabled one of the
//! `dtls-<LIBRARY NAME>-sys` features, in which case those will have priority.
//! If multiple of these features are enabled, they are prioritized in the same order as used by
//! `libcoap` (openssl > mbedtls > tinydtls).
//!
//! ## `pkg-config` Build System
//!
//! The `pkg-config` build system utilizes the `pkg-config` utility available on most Unix-like
//! systems to link against a system-provided version of `libcoap`.
//! To do so, it uses the [`pkg_config`](https://docs.rs/pkg-config/latest/pkg_config/) crate, and
//! you may therefore customize the build process by setting the environment variables described in
//! that library's documentation (which may be of special relevance if you try to cross compile).
//!
//! By default, it will probe `pkg-config` for a library with the name `libcoap-3`, which will
//! usually symlink to the DTLS library variant of libcoap that was installed most recently.
//! If you have explicitly requested use of a specific DTLS library, this build system will attempt
//! to find the `libcoap-3-<LIBRARY NAME>` library instead.
//!
//! However, library selection does not take into account any other requested features (i.e., it
//! will not check for feature support before generating the bindings), but will use header-based
//! compile-time feature checks (see the general section) to ensure support for all required
//! features after binding generation.
//!
//! The `dtls-<LIBRARY NAME>-sys` features have no effect on this build system, but note that static
//! linking against a system-provided version of `libcoap` may cause issues if it causes multiple
//! versions of the same DTLS library to be statically linked into the same Rust binary.
//!
//! ## `manual` Build System
//!
//! This build system is intended as a fallback solution if all other options fail. It will attempt
//! to generate bindings and link against the version of `libcoap` that is described by the
//! following environment variables:
//!
//! - `LIBCOAP_RS_INCLUDE_DIRS`: Paths that should be added to `clang`'s include path to search for
//!                              header files (e.g., `/usr/local/include`, _not_
//!                              `/usr/local/include/coap3`). Multiple values are separated by
//!                              colons (`:`).
//! - `LIBCOAP_RS_LIB_DIRS`:     Paths that should be added to `rustc`'s library path to search for
//!                              object files to link against. Multiple values are separated by
//!                              colons (`:`).
//! - `LIBCOAP_RS_STATIC`:       Set to any non-zero and non-empty value to instruct `rustc` to use
//!                              static linking instead of dynamic linking for `libcoap`.
//! - `LIBCOAP_RS_ADDITIONAL_LIBRARIES`: Additional libraries (such as DTLS libraries) that should
//!                              be linked against, separated by colons (`:`).
//!                              Note that these will be added after `libcoap`, and that the order
//!                              in which they are specified matters for most linkers.
//!                              You may also request static linking by prepending `static=` to the
//!                              library name.
//!
//! ## `espidf` Build System
//!
//! This build system will be used instead of the regular `vendored` build if you are building for
//! targets that are based on the `ESP-IDF`.
//!
//! If `libcoap-sys` is a direct dependency, it will automatically enable the
//! [`espressif/coap`](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/coap) component in
//! order to instruct `esp-idf-sys` to compile and link `libcoap` and generate bindings for it.
//!
//! If you encounter errors that indicate that the `espressif/coap` component may not be enabled in
//! the ESP-IDF, this could have the following reasons:
//! - You may have to run `cargo clean`, as the `esp-idf-sys` build script does not always detect
//!     changes in requested extra components properly.
//! - `libcoap-sys` is a transient dependency: the `esp-idf-sys` build script
//!     [only considers metadata from the root crate and its direct dependencies](https://docs.esp-rs.org/esp-idf-sys/esp_idf_sys/#extra-esp-idf-components)
//!     to determine which components to install.
//!     In order to solve this, you can either add `libcoap-sys` as a direct dependency, or copy
//!     this crate's `src/wrapper.h` file and add the following snippet to your own `Cargo.toml`.
//!     ```cargo
//!     [[package.metadata.esp-idf-sys.extra_components]]
//!     remote_component = { name = "espressif/coap", version = "4.3.5~3" }
//!     bindings_header = "src/wrapper.h"
//!     ```
//!     Afterward, run `cargo clean` (see the issue mentioned above) and try again.
//!
//! It will then parse the generated bindings file and re-export all symbols in `esp-idf-sys` that
//! are related to `libcoap`.
//!
//! Note that `esp-idf-sys` may use a different version of `bindgen` than the other build systems
//! and that bindings might differ slightly as a result.
//!
//! Unlike most other targets, this one will use `esp-idf-sys` instead of `libc` to provide its
//! standard library types (see the generic information section above).

// Bindgen translates the C headers, clippy's and rustfmt's recommendations are not applicable here.
