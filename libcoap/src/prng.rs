//! Module containing methods for accessing or configuring the libcoap PRNG.
//!
//! This module provides basic functions to seed the libcoap PRNG and retrieve random bytes from it.
//!
//! Additionally, if the `rand` feature is enabled, this module contains integrations with the
//! [rand] crate that allow using the libcoap PRNG as a [rand::Rng] or setting the libcoap PRNG to
//! an existing [rand::Rng].
